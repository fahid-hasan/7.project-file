						My occupation of choice is web designer, and I chose this because even though I don’t know everything about computers I am very fast at learning about them. It’s never too late to start this occupation and I know if I put time and effort into this\ I know I will love it and I can be good at it. As a web designer I will create and keep up with websites, including the layout, and function according to the client. (Web Developer) Web designing has really developed over time ever since the “World Wide Web” was created and it has visually improved as well as the speed and mobility. The requirements for this occupation vary with what kind of work that they do, they can range from a high school diploma to a bachelor’s degree. Though…show more content…
						Many list a Bachelor of Science degree as the educational requirement. These are 4-year degrees, which mean they typically require 4 years of education beyond the completion of high school. Simple computer classes at this school could benefit in achieving this career but over all I don’t think they would help in becoming advanced in this occupation. Full Sail University has a Bachelor’s degree program in web design and development, this program isn’t the cheapest but its guaranteed to give a good education. The cost of this program from this school is about $80,000, but the students enrolled in this program study web design and development for Internet sites.

			<p>The use of websites as educational tools provides a unique way for students to access material in a variety of different formats. However, while educational websites may increase access to information, they also present their own challenges. Research suggests that only 16% of people read webpages word-for-word. Most people scan (Nielson, 1997). Additionally, people often spend only a few seconds exploring a site before determining whether to stay or leave. And, with the distracting world of the Internet, where a funny cat video is only a click away, it is even more challenging to maintain readers’ attention on a website. 

				When you are writing for the web, you must create content that is captivating, engaging, and informative while also being easy to scan. This means writing for the web looks very different than writing for print. Check out our chapter overview video to see an example of how to transform a traditional print paragraph into text that is easy to read on a website. </p>
